The Lieb-Schultz-Mattis theorem constrains the possible low-energy and long-distance behaviors of states which emerge from microscopic lattice Hamiltonians. The theorem dictates that the emergent state cannot be a trivial symmetric insulator if the filling per unit cell is not integral and if lattice translation symmetry and particle number conservation are strictly imposed. Investigating one-dimensional symmetric gapless states which are forced to be critical by the theorem, we show that the theorem, the absence of a trivial insulator phase at non-integral filling, has a very close connection to quantum anomaly. We further show that, in terms of symmetry realizations on low-energy modes, low-energy spectrum, and anomaly, the gapless states emergent from lattice Hamiltonians are equivalent to the boundary theory of the strong symmetry-protected topological phases in one-higher dimensions, where non-local translational symmetry of the lattice is encoded as some local symmetry. Once a global symmetry is realized in a non-on-site fashion, the boundary of the topological phases can be realized in a stand-alone lattice model, and the no-go theorem for the boundary is circumvented, similar to the recent discussions of the half-filled Landau level and topological insulators. Finally we extend our analysis to the higher-dimensional example, the Dirac semimetal in three spatial dimensions.
